TEALS On GitHub
====================================================================================================

[TEALSK12] is the official GitHub organization page for [TEALS] projects and repositories. This
includes a number of projects, some public, some private. Our public repositories are open to
students, teachers, schools, and the general public. Our private repositories are for teachers and
educators to assist with the development of computer science curriculum and associated code.

### [TEALS Wiki](https://github.com/TEALSK12/tealsk12.github.io/wiki/)
This is the primary wiki for TEALS on GitHub. Individual repositories may have their own wikis, but
all generally useful information should go in the main wiki.

### [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/TEALSK12/tealsk12.github.io/issues/)
All general issues regarding the TEALS organization on GitHub. Issues that are specific to a
particular repository belong in the issues collection for that repository. If you're not sure where
something belongs, then just add it to the general issues and we'll sort it out.

### [TEALS on GitHub Web Site](https://tealsk12.github.io/)
Our main web page for [TEALS on GitHub] contains a general introduction to our GitHub organization
and the resources it contains.


## Contributing
If you are a teacher or interested contributor, send your GitHub user id to [Steve Hollasch], and
I'll verify your status and add you as a contributor.

If you would like to have us host your project, curriculum, or other TEALS-associated material, that
would be great! GitHub has graciously granted us 25 free private repositories (public repositories
are always unlimited), so we'd love to include your contributions.
