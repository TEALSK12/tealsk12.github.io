TEALS On GitHub
====================================================================================================

[TEALSK12] is the official GitHub organization page for [TEALS] projects and repositories. This
includes a number of projects, some public, some private. Our public repositories are open to
students, teachers, schools, and the general public. Our private repositories are for teachers and
educators to assist with the development of computer science curriculum and associated code.

## Contributing
If you are a teacher or interested contributor, send your GitHub user id to [Steve Hollasch], and
I'll verify your status and add you as a contributor.

If you would like to have us host your project, curriculum, or other TEALS-associated material, that
would be great! GitHub has graciously granted us 25 free private repositories (public repositories
are always unlimited), so we'd love to include your contributions.
