# TEALS on GitHub
[TEALSK12](https://github.com/TEALSK12) is the official GitHub location for
[TEALS](http://tealsk12.com/) projects and repositories. We have a number of projects, many public,
a some private. Our public repositories are open to students, teachers, schools, and the like to use
as you wish. Our private repositories are for teachers and educators to assist with the development
of computer science curriculum.

## Contributing
If you are a teacher or interested contributor, send your GitHub user id to [Steve
Hollasch](mailto:steve@hollasch.net), and I'll add you as a contributor.

If you would like to have us host your project, curriculum, or other TEALS-associated repository,
that would be great! GitHub has graciously granted us 25 free private repositories (public
repositories are always unlimited), so we'd love to include your awesome project.
